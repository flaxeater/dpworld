Requirements:
Write a program that can accept the sample XML file below, and create data in the relevant DB tables,
Output the Order data to the screen and allow a user to amend/update it,
Provide DB design, showing relationships between tables, code file(s)

Comments:
Database Scheme is found in schema.sql which was auto generated by the ORM.
The database engine chosen was sqlite, for ease of deployment and quick startup.  

I essentially mapped the xml directly into ORM models so the hierarchical relationship matches the xml as much as possible.  Though I did throw away the envelope and instead focused on the orders specifically and required that order.referenceNum.num was UNIQUE.  I decided to make the reference number mutable for completeness but I pondered over wether it should be immutable.  

I used UUID for id's for a bit more security and tightly bound the rows to make future joining easier, the orm was very supportive of this idea.  

I put this together as quickly as I could, so there's many things keeping me from calling this done, but the main features are present.
